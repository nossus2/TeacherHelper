    These activities are intended for educational use.
    They use GPT 3.5 Turbo as the AI.
    If you encounter any bugs, errors, or invalid responses, please report them to edtech@indianmountain.org.

    **Lesson Planner** allows you to specify a format, subject, a topic, and present additional constraints to the AI.
    It will return a project, lesson, worksheet, athletics practice, etc.  You can ask the AI to refine its response to 
    best fit your needs.
